Gravity Simulator by Emre Ge√ßit

main.py is the main file,

functions.py includes the functions used in main,

variables.py includes variables that can be changed,

constants.py includes constants that shouldn't be changed.

To run the simulator, run main.py with python.

After running the program, left click to create new planet, right click to delete planet, scroll when your cursor is on a planet to feed or shrink a planet.

There are some modes that can be changed inside variables.py:

"edge_mode"s: "reflect", "respawn"

"color_mode"s: "random", "normal"

"collision_mode"s: 1, 2 (1 is not does not completely reflect real world physics formulas, but stable; 2 is the implementation of the real collision formulas, but buggy)

I am not satisfied with the current collision system. if you have a better collision idea, please contact me.
